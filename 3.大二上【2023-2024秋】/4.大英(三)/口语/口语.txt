Hometown
I'm from a small village which located in HuNan YiYang
Now I live in a town not far from my hometown
What impressed me most is the cultural atmosphere of the city.People live a leisurely life,for example,they pase time by dancing in Square, walking and playing balls.
I do not like the city's traffic jam.when i Go home from school,I need to be stuck in traffic for half an hour.
No,I want to go to bigger city to Seek opportunities and Make a living in the future.
